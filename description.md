### Rallygram: Who what were why?

#### What is Rallygram?
Rallygram is an app to amplify and share goodwill for another person. Excited for someone to join your team? Someone close to you have a baby? Did someone go out of their way to make the world a better place?

#### What do I need to make a Rallygram?
Just yourself to get started. Think of someone you'd like to send goodwill to and use the app to rally the folks around them to express their appreciations, gratitude, love, advice, or blessings for. You'll just need first names and phone numbers for everyone you'd like to invite to particpate.

##### User types
a) the initiator (one person, that's you)
b) participant (many people that you invite, will include you, the initiator)
c) recipient (one person that will receive messages from the participants)

#### How does Rallygram work?

##### Step 1: initiator creates rallygram
create prompt for participants by filling in madlib
will collect:
	- title of rallygram
	- recipients name
	- occasion

##### Step 2: initiator creates participant list
- input names
- input phone numbers
- optional: mms v-cards to custom phone number

##### Step 3: initiator adds recipient details
- input recipients phone number
- set window for rallys to be collected
	- in one hour increments

##### Step 4: RALLY!
- app texts each particpant with prompt
- possible responses: 
	"now"
		- app calls recipient and takes recording
	"stop"
		- app stops and removes participant from rallygram
	"later"
		- try back in an hour
	no response
		- try back in an hour
	... more ...

##### Step 5: SEND
- once time slot has closed, rallygrams will be sent to recipient 
- recipient gets sms with 
	- description 
	- link to custom page
	- phone number to call to hear messages

- Custom page has 
	- option to save recordings
	- option to respond to everyone (sms)
	- option to create new rallygram
